#Text Enigma App 

A small project of mine. It's a web app that was inspired by the German enigma Machine. Two or more individuals can share messages between themselves by first encrypting the message via the app with a key. The key is communicate to the intended recipient; and the recipient decodes the encrypted message using the key on the app. I utilized the CryptoJS library for this project.
